# Plume-model
1-D cloud resolving model, which simulates the vertical extent of plume rises generated from wildfires. This model was based on the work of Freitas et al. (2007;2010) and Mallia et al. (2018). This model builds upon previous work by adding functionality to the Freitas model so that it can be compatible with environmental conditions derived from the Weather Research Forecast model (WRF), and fire input data provided via text files.


Refer to the user guide document (WRF compatible Freitas Model User Guide.pdf) provided with the code for installation instructions, dependencies, inputs and a sample test case. Files relevant for the test case can be found at the following link: [http://home.chpc.utah.edu/~u0703457/my_research/PREEVENTS/freitas_model/test_case/](https://home.chpc.utah.edu/~u0703457/Freitas_model_test_case/)
